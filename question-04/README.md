## Your dream team has 3 or 4 members. What would you do if you had destroyed a service by accident?

- Notify the team about the cause of the service being destroyed because of me.
- A brief description of my previous actions that may have inadvertently caused the error.
- Try to restore service as quickly as possible and ask for help from the team.

## How about if it was your colleague that done it ?

- Request some information about the colleague's actions that may have caused the service failure.
- Help colleagues and teams to restore service as quickly as possible.
